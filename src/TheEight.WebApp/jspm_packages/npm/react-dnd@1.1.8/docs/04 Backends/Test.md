Test
===================

The `Test` backend lets you test the drag and drop interaction of your components even without the DOM.  
Due to time constraints, this is currently the most underdocumented part of React DnD, but you are welcome to learn from the usage example in the [testing](docs-testing.html) tutorial, and contribute to the docs.

### Importing

It is only available in the CommonJS build.  
Import it from `react-dnd/modules/backends/Test`.

### Usage

See the second example in the [testing](docs-testing.html) tutorial.
